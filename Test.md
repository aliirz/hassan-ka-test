Python Test for First-Semester Students
======================================

Section 1: Basic Python Syntax (20 points)
----------------------------------------

1. Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. Define a variable "x" and assign it the value 5. How do you print the 
value of "x"?
3. What is the difference between "for" and "while" loops in Python? 
Provide an example for each.
4. Write a program that asks the user for their name, and then prints 
"Hello, [name]!" to the console.
5. Define a function "add(x, y)" that takes two arguments and returns 
their sum. How do you call this function?

Section 2: Data Structures (30 points)
----------------------------------------

1. Write a program that stores names, ages, and genders of three people in
a list. How would you access the information of each person in the list?
2. Define a class "Student" with attributes "name", "age", and "gender". 
How do you create an instance of this class?
3. Write a program that creates a dictionary of students with their names,
ages, and genders. How would you access the information of each student in
the dictionary?
4. Define a list of marks for three subjects (English, Math, Science). How
would you access the marks of each subject in the list?
5. Write a program that stores the marks of five students in a list. How 
do you calculate the average mark of all the students in the list?

Section 3: Control Structures (20 points)
----------------------------------------

1. What is the difference between "if", "elif", and "else" statements in 
Python? Provide an example for each.
2. Write a program that asks the user for their favorite color, and then 
prints "You like [color]!" if the color is blue, else it prints "Sorry, 
that's not a valid color."
3. Define a function "check_date(date)" that takes a date as input and 
returns "True" if the date is today, else returns "False". How do you call
this function?
4. Write a program that asks the user for their age, and then prints "You 
are [age] years old!" if the user's age is greater than or equal to 18, 
else it prints "Sorry, you need to be 18 or older."
5. Define a list of numbers from 1 to 10. How would you find the number 
that is odd?

Section 4: Functions (30 points)
------------------------------

1. Write a program that defines and calls a function "add(x, y)" that 
takes two arguments and returns their sum.
2. Define a function "square(x)" that takes a number as input and returns 
its square. How do you call this function?
3. Write a program that defines and calls a function "mean(numbers)" that 
takes a list of numbers as input and returns their mean.
4. Define a function "filter(list, predicate)" that takes a list and a 
predicate function as input and returns a new list with the elements that 
satisfy the predicate. How do you call this function?
5. Write a program that defines and calls a function "sort_list(list)" 
that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a sorted list.

Section 5: Modules (20 points)
------------------------------

1. What is a module in Python? Provide an example of a built-in module and
how you can use it in your program.
2. Write a program that imports the "math" module and uses its functions 
to calculate the square root of a number.
3. Define a module "my_module" with a function "add(x, y)" that takes two 
arguments and returns their sum. How do you import this module in another 
file?
4. Write a program that imports the "random" module and uses its functions
to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
5. Define a module "my_module2" with a function "mean(numbers)" that takes
a list of numbers as input and returns their mean. How do you use this 
module in another file?
